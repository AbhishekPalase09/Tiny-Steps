# TinySteps
The "TINY STEPS" is a mini-project aimed at improving the vaccination experience for parents and caregivers. The website is designed to collect information regarding the administration of vaccines for infants and young children (ages 0-16 years). This is also helpful for doctors to keep the record of vaccination. Also there is awareness regarding vaccination and about the myths which are spread in the society. "WE ENCOURAGE VACCINATION !!!"
